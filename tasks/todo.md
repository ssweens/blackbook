## Universal Action Contract Convergence - Phase 2 (v0.23.0) ✅ DONE

### Completed
- [x] Removed remaining non-destructive detail-close behavior for skill uninstall-all in `App.tsx`
- [x] Updated `action-dispatch.ts` so skill uninstall-all now calls `refreshDetailSkill` (same contract as other non-destructive actions)
- [x] Updated `store.refreshAll()` to always invoke `refreshDetail()` after reloads
- [x] Updated `store.syncTools()` to await targeted reloads (`loadFiles`, `loadInstalledPlugins`, `loadPiPackages`) and call `refreshDetail()`
- [x] Updated `store.pullbackFileInstance()` to await `refreshAll()` (no more fire-and-forget stale detail windows)
- [x] Added dispatcher regression test for skill uninstall-all refresh contract
- [x] Added store regression test for sync-detail refresh contract
- [x] Passed quality gates: typecheck, build, and full test suite (`474/474`)
- [x] Performed tmux visual verification captures (`/tmp/bbverify-start2.txt`, `/tmp/bbverify-loaded.txt`)

### Result
All previously identified remaining contract gaps are now closed in the primary action paths. Non-destructive mutations preserve detail state and refresh from fresh store data consistently.

### Notes
- The universal contract checklist remains the source of truth for future features and regressions.
- Keep using tmux capture verification for UI-affecting changes.

## Follow-up bugfix (2026-05-18): Pi should show ssmp as installed

### Problem
- User reported Pi should show `ssmp` skillset as installed but UI did not.

### Root cause
- `getStandaloneSkills()` for non-flat tools (`pluginFlatInstall=false`) only scanned namespaced layout (`skills/<namespace>/<skill>/SKILL.md`).
- Actual Pi disk state was legacy flat layout (`skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`), so installs were missed and rendered as source-only.

### Fix
- Added compatibility scan path for non-flat tools to also detect legacy flat layout.
- Kept preferred namespaced behavior intact.
- Source-repo namespace mapping still assigns `ssmp` via `skills/ssmp/<skill>/SKILL.md`.

### Validation
- Real file state: confirmed Pi skill dirs exist on disk.
- Scanner state: `getStandaloneSkills()` now reports `ssmp` skills with Pi installations.
- App/store state: `loadInstalledPlugins()` now yields `standaloneSkills` with `namespace==='ssmp'` and Pi installs.
- Added integration tests:
  - `detects flat Pi skills on disk and maps them to ssmp namespace via source_repo`
  - `installs standalone skills to namespaced paths on non-flat tools`
  - `migrates legacy flat standalone skills to namespaced paths`
- Test suite now: `477/477` passing.
- Real migration verified on local Pi disk: legacy `~/.pi/agent/skills/<skill>` moved to `~/.pi/agent/skills/ssmp/<skill>` for 27 ssmp skills.
- **Namespace tree Enter key**: pressing Enter on a skill-header now opens the full standalone skill detail view (identical to Skills section), with all per-tool actions. Right arrow expands/collapses. Verified via tmux UI capture.
